# Social banners

This is a tool which generates social banners from parameters passed from a form, which generates a query string to generate that image on the fly.

## Local development

The simplest way to run the site locally is using the [`dotrun`](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/dotrun/) and [`docker`](https://snapcraft.io/docker) snaps:

```
dotrun
```

Once the server has started, you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:8057](http://127.0.0.1:8057) in your browser.

After you close the server with `<ctrl>+c`.
